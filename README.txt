====================
The Starzel Buildout
====================

    :target: https://travis-ci.org/starzel/buildout

This is a standard Plone-buildout of the company `Starzel.de <http://www.starzel.de>`_.

.. contents::


Main features
-------------

* It extends to config- and version-files on github shared by all projects that use the sameÂ version of Plone.
* It allows to update a project simply by changing the version it extends.
* It allows to update all projects of one version by changing remote files (very useful for HotFixes).
* It is minimal work to setup a new project.
* It has presets for development, testing, staging and production.
* It has all the nice development-helpers we use.


Structure
---------

``buildout.cfg``
    This contains the project settings (name, addons, checkouts etc.).

``local.cfg``
    For each environment (development, production, test) there is a separate ``local_*.cfg``-file. You create a *symlink*  called ``local.cfg`` to one of these files depending on your environment. Each of the files includes the remote ``base.cfg`` that is hosted on github like this:

    .. code-block:: ini

        extends = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starzel/buildout/5.0.6/linkto/base.cfg

    This example refers to the tag 5.0.6 of this buildout that uses Plone 5.0.6 To use a different Plone-version simply change that to point to a different tag.

``base.cfg``
    This remote file conatains most of the commonly used logic used for prodcution. It also includes two version-files that are also hosted on github:

    * `pinned_versions.cfg <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starzel/buildout/5.0.6/linkto/pinned_versions.cfg>`_: Pinns the Plone-version using http://dist.plone.org/release/5.0.6/versions.cfg
    * `floating_versions.cfg <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starzel/buildout/5.0.6/linkto/floating_versions.cfg>`_: Pinns all commonly used addons of this buildout.

``pinned_versions_project.cfg``
    Here you pinn versions to overwrite or extend the hosted ``pinned_versions.cfg``. These eggs are usually pinned for a reason and are usually not safe to be upgraded.

``floating_versions_project.cfg``
    Here you overwrite and extend the hosted ``floating_versions.cfg``. These eggs should usually be safe to be upgraded. ``./bin/checkversions floating_versions_project.cfg`` will check pypi if there are newer releases for your pinned eggs.

To develop against the current `Coredev <https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev/tree/5.0>`_ use ``local_coredev.cfg``.

Please note that new features are not introduced to old versions.

Tags for development-versions (alpha, beta and rc) will exists but will be removed after the final release of that version.


Quickstart
----------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/starzel/buildout SOME_PROJECT
    $ cd SOME_PROJECT

Remove all files that are not needed for a project but are only used for the buildout itself.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rm -rf linkto README.rst README.txt .travis.yml secret.cfg_tmpl VERSION.txt local_coredev.cfg CHANGES.rst

If you're not developing the buildout itself you want a create a new git repo.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rm -rf .git && git init

Add a file that contains a passwort. Do **not** use ``admin`` as a password in production!

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo -e "[buildout]\nlogin = admin\npassword = admin" > secret.cfg

Symlink to the file that best fits you local environment. At first that is usually development. Later you can use production or test. This buildout only uses ``local.cfg`` and ignores all ``local_*.cfg``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ln -s local_develop.cfg local.cfg

Build Plone

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv-2.7 .
    $ ./bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ ./bin/buildout


Configuring a project
---------------------

``buildout.cfg`` contains the general project settings. Here you configure the name of the project, the eggs, source-checkouts and languages Plone will use.


Use in development
------------------

Symlink to the development-config:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ln -s local_develop.cfg local.cfg

The development-setup will build a simple instance with some useful tools (see below). The setup assumes that zeo, varnish and haproxy are only configured on production.


Use in production
-----------------

Symlink to the production-config:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ln -s local_production.cfg local.cfg

A average project could use this stack pipeline::

    nginx > varnish > nginx > 2 x zeoclients > zeoserver

In ``local_production.cfg`` select the parts you really need.

.. code-block:: ini

    parts +=
        ${buildout:zeo-multi-parts}
        ${buildout:varnish}
        ${buildout:supervisor-parts}
        ${buildout:cron-parts}
        logrotate
        precompiler

Also modify ``templates/supervisord.conf`` to have supervisor manage the parts you want to use.

Server stack
++++++++++++

``Frontend webserver (Nginx)``
    The first Nginx manages the virtualhost, rewirtes if needed and terminates the SSL (before varnish). A minimal config cloud be found in the  `demo.plone.de project <https://github.com/collective/demo.plone.de/blob/master/templates/nginx.conf>`_.
    More information can also be found in the `PloneDocs <https://docs.plone.org/manage/deploying/front-end/nginx.html#minimal-nginx-front-end-configuration-for-plone-on-ubuntu-debian-linux>`_

``Cache (Varnish)``
    After nginx we use varnish to cache the site. You can activate it like this:

    .. code-block:: ini

        # comment out what you need
        parts += # Choose one!
        ...
        ${buildout:varnish}
        ...

    Take a look in ``linkto/base.cfg`` for the varnish4-config & varnish parts, there are several switches to configure.

    It is best practice to install varnish from your distribution repository. If this is not possible you can build it by adding the part ``varnish-build``:

    .. code-block:: ini

        parts +=
            varnish-build
            ${buildout:varnish}

        [varnish-build]
        recipe = plone.recipe.varnish:build
        url = https://repo.varnish-cache.org/source/varnish-4.0.4.tar.gz
        varnish_version = 4.0

    If you use the system-varnish you need to tell that varnish about your config and also override the some settings in the part ``[varnish4]`` with whatever your systems varnish needs. Here is one example:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [varnish4]
        daemon = /usr/sbin/varnishd
        pid = /var/run/varnishd.pid

``Loadbalancer (Nginx)``
    Another Nginx spreads the requests to several Zeoclients, here is a minimal config. In production you can look at `demo.plone.de project <https://github.com/collective/demo.plone.de/blob/master/templates/nginx.conf>`_

    .. code-block:: ini
        # starzel (zeoclients)
        upstream starzel_zeoclients {
            ip_hash;
            server 127.0.0.1:8082;
            server 127.0.0.1:8083;
            server 127.0.0.1:8084;
            }

    The ``ip_hash`` option is needed for multiple Zeoclients, more information can be found in this `issue <https://github.com/collective/plone.recipe.varnish/issues/37>`_

    The ip and port has be the same as the settings for the zeoclients in then part ``[bindips]`` and ``[ports]``.


Use for test-instances
----------------------

Create a copy of ``local_production.cfg`` called ``local_test.cfg`` and modify it according to your needs.

.. warning::

    If test runs on the same server as production:

    In this case you need a different name for the project on test. Otherwise one will overwrite the database of the other. Because of this the name of the project must **not** be set in ``buildout.cfg`` but in the ``local_*.cfg``-files.


Features
--------

Debugging and Development
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

packages
    All eggs of your buildout will be symlinked to in ``parts/packages``.

zopepy
    Run ``./bin/zopepy`` to have a python-prompt with all eggs of your buildout in its python-path.

checkversions
    Run ``./bin/checkversions floating_versions_project.cfg`` to check if your pinned eggs are up-to-date.

codeintel
    This part uses ``corneti.recipes.codeintel`` to prepare for codeintel-integration (useful for users of Sublime Text).

stacktrace
    The part ``stacktrace-script`` adds a bash-script ``./bin/stack.sh`` that will print the current stacktrace to stdout. Useful to find out what Plone is doing when it's busy.

code-analysis
    This installs a pre-commit-hook that runs the codeanalysis-tests from ``plone.recipe.codeanalysis``.

mrbob
    This part adds `bobtemplates.plone <https://github.com/collective/bobtemplates.plone>`_ to simplify the creation of new addons.

test
    Run tests for your test-eggs

coverage-test
    Generate coverage-reports for your test-eggs in parts/test/.


i18n
++++

Restrict loaded languages
    By default only german ('de') is loaded on startup. In your ``buildout.cfg`` you can override the loaded languages using ``language = de en fr``. This setting also affects the languages used in the ``i18nize-xxx`` part. (see http://maurits.vanrees.org/weblog/archive/2010/10/i18n-plone-4#restrict-the-loaded-languages)

i18nize-diff
    Show differences of the po files against what is currently in git.
    This script uses `podiff <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/podiff>`_ that filters out a lot of noise like creation dates and line numbers.
    So this output is much more usable.
    Use this script in jenkins together with i18nize-all to make sure that you po files are up to date.

i18nize-xxx
    Modify the commented-out part ``i18nize-xxx`` to get a script that runs i18ndude fro an egg. Here is an example for the egg ``dynajet.site`` adding a script ``./bin/i18nize-site``.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [i18nize-site]
        recipe = collective.recipe.template
        input = ${buildout:directory}/i18nize.in
        output = ${buildout:bin-directory}/i18nize-site
        mode = 775
        dollar = $
        domain = dynajet.site
        packagepath = ${buildout:directory}/src/dynajet.site/src/dynajet/site
        languages = ${buildout:languages}

i18nize-all
    This runs all i18nize commands for a package.


Testing
+++++++

Setup for gitlab-ci and jenkins
    Configure your ci-system to run the script ``./bootstrap_ci.sh``. This will configure and run the whole buildout.


Deployment
++++++++++

monitoring
    Change the settings for ``maxram`` to have memmon restart an instance when it uses up to much memory.

Sentry logging
    Configure zeoclients to send tracebacks to Sentry in ``local_production.cfg`` by uncommenting it and adding a dsn. You also need to enable the egg ``raven``. Repeat for each zeoclient.


Hotfixes
++++++++

This buildout automatically includes the correct Hotfixes for the version of Plone you use. E.g. the extends-file for Plone 5.0.6 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starzel/buildout/5.0.6/linkto/base.cfg  pulls in the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starzel/buildout/master/linkto/hotfixes/5.0.6.cfg which in turn contains the pinns and eggs for all HotFixes for that version.

By having the hotfixes-files in the master-branch we can easily update Hotfixes for each version without having to move any tags. The same day a Hotfix is published the corresponding extends-files will be updated. You simply have to rerun buildout and restart your site to include them.


Notes
-----

``local.cfg`` and ``secret.cfg`` must **never** be versioned. The file ``.gitignore`` in this buildoutÂ already prevent this.

It might feels weird that ``buildout.cfg`` loads ``local.cfg``, but this avoids some weird behavior of buildouts extends-feature.


To have different supervisor-configurations for test-servers by adding a file ``templates/supervisord-test.conf`` and referencing it in local_test.cfg:

.. code-block:: ini

    [supervisor-conf]
        input= ${buildout:directory}/templates/supervisord-test.conf
